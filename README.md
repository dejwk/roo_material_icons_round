# roo_material_icons_round
Sub-collection of 'round' icons for use with the [roo_display](https://github.com/dejwk/roo_display) library. Icons are coming from Google's open-source [material icons collection](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons), used in Android and other Google products.

Full collection is available at https://github.com/dejwk/roo_material_icons. This sub-collection only contains the 'round' family, and it therefore compiles significantly faster.
